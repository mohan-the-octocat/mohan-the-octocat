## Hi there 👋

- I help Enterprises write their DevOps success stories on GitHub.com
- I am passionate about creating 🪴 , building 🏗️ and seeing 👀 ideas come to fruition!
- I would be keen to hear what your DevOps story is! Preferably with a cup of coffee!

## Fun fact: 🪄
As a kid, I would dream of becoming a magician since they could pull out things out of thin air! As I grew up, I realized Software engineers were magicians in their own right, and ended up becoming one!
